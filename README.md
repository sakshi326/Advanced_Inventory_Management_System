# Advanced_Inventory_Management_System

This is an advanced Inventory Management System designed for a warehouse using Java Collections. The system efficiently manages inventory items, handles category-wise sorting, provides restocking notifications, supports bulk operations, and allows complex queries. It utilizes Java's collection framework classes like `Map`, `Set`, `Queue`, and others to manage large inventories.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

1. **Inventory Tracking**:
    - Each item in the inventory has a unique ID, a name, a category (e.g., electronics, furniture, groceries), and a quantity.
    - Efficient storage for operations like searching, adding, updating, and deleting items based on their unique ID.

2. **Category-wise Sorting and Retrieval**:
    - Items within a category are sorted in descending order of their quantity.
    - Efficient retrieval of all items belonging to a particular category.

3. **Restocking Notifications**:
    - If an item's quantity drops below a specified threshold, a restocking notification is triggered (console output).

4. **Bulk Operations**:
    - Merge two inventories while ensuring no duplicate item IDs. In case of duplicates, the item with the higher quantity is retained.

5. **Complex Query Support**:
    - Retrieve the top `k` items with the highest quantity, regardless of category.

## üì¶ Constraints
- The system handles at least 100,000 items efficiently.
- Utilizes optimal Java collection classes like `Map`, `Set`, `Queue`, and others.

## üíª Implementation

The system is built using Java and utilizes the Java Collections Framework for efficient management of large inventories. It consists of the following main components:

1. **Inventory Class**: 
    - Manages items, their IDs, names, categories, and quantities.
    - Handles inventory operations like add, remove, update, search, and merge.

2. **Notification System**:
    - Monitors inventory quantities and triggers notifications when restocking is required.

3. **Query System**:
    - Allows for complex queries like retrieving the top `k` items with the highest quantity.
